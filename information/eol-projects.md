# EOL Projects

EOL projects are projects previously supported and developed by Starlight, but now will no longer be kept up-to-date. This means, Starlight has no guaruntee on the quality of this project in the future, and it may slowly become buggy as services it uses update around it.



Projects can become EOL for many reasons, including:

* Lack of developer support (intense burnout, loss of interest, ect)
* Lack of user interest (low use counts, no feedback, dying community, ect)

and more!



Here at Starlight, we are sad to see some of our older projects become EOL, but as life moves on, we are forced to make our older projects become them. However, do not fear, EOL doesn't always mean a complete drop of a game! Many of our best ideas become remade in the future, updated to patch large bugs, and generally continue to be loved by us and the community through years in the future!
