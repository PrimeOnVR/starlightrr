# EOL Projects

EOL projects are projects previously supported and developed by Starlight, but now will no longer be kept up-to-date. This means, Starlight has no guarantee on the quality of this project in the future, and it may slowly become buggy as services it uses update around it.



Here at Starlight, we are sad to see some of our older projects become EOL, but as life moves on, we are forced to make our older projects become them. However, do not fear, EOL doesn't always mean a complete drop of a game! Many of our best ideas become remade in the future, updated to patch large bugs, and generally continue to be loved by us and the community through years in the future!



## EOL Reasons

Projects can become EOL for many reasons, including:

* Lack of developer support (intense burnout, loss of interest, ect)
* Lack of user interest (low use counts, no feedback, dying community, ect)

and more!



## EOL Types

In addition, not all EOL projects are created equal, as there are multiple types of EOL. These types are:



### MEOL (Minor-End-of-life)

Minor EOL projects are in a semi-dead state, as they may be updated for patches from Starlight. These patches tend to be spread out, and extremely small, but still serve as keeping the project usable. Our team at Starlight tries to keep these games up to our quality bars, but depending on the project, that may not be possible



### FEOL (Full-End-of-life)

Full EOL projects are some of the most dead projects you may ever encounter. Patch updates for them are extremely unlikely, and they are usually already buggy before this badge has even been slapped on. They do not need to reach any of Starlight's quality bars, and usually don't anyway.
