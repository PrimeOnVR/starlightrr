# Usage Guidelines

When using Starlight's assets, you must follow these rules if you plan to use the assets in any way. Those rules are split up into two parts. Those two parts are what you can do, and what you can't do with our assets. Here are the rules:



## What you can do

* Use Starlight assets when writing articles, making videos, or other content about Starlight,
* Use Starlight assets to credit us on projects we have worked on, that involve you.



## What you can't do

* Use Starlight assets to impersonate or pretend to be Starlight,
* Use Starlight assets for defamation, of us or our partners,
* Use Starlight assets to train AI without our explicit permission.



These rules are all-encompassing, and if a use case is not covered, assume that it is not allowed. If you still believe it should be allowed, let us know in the [discord-server.md](../../projects/external/first-party/discord-server.md "mention").
