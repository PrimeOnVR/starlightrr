# Command and Tagging standards

Noxis uses Camel Case for its command and tagging standard. While not necessary, for good practice, you should write your commands and tags in it.

Camel Case is where you write your variables with the first letter of each word capitalized, with the first word being all lowercase, or in other words, in this format:

```
someVariableName
thisIsAVariable
```
