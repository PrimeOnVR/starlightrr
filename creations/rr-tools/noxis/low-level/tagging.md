# Tagging

Noxis runs on Rec Room tags for many parts of how it works, like service names, service calling, groups, and much much more. As a basic rundown, start your group tags with `ng` and your service tags with `ns` , or, in easier to understand terms, like this:

```
nsExampleService - a Noxis Service
ngExampleGroup - a Noxis Group
```

You can do all kinds of things with these tags, such as call services in groups using the [noxis-communicator.md](../noxis-parts/noxis-communicator.md "mention"), and much, much more!
