# Noxis Dictionary

Noxis dictionaries are found in several places, such as the [rom.md](rom.md "mention") and [queued-communications.md](queued-communications.md "mention"). They can be searched via the [search-for-keys-in-rom-external.md](../noxis-tools/search-for-keys-in-rom-external.md "mention") tool, and are a low-level way to get data in a robust way.

```
key˽value
```

They are formatted with a key and a value, split by the `˽` character.
