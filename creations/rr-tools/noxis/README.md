# Noxis

Noxis by Starlight is a system of operations designed entirely inside RR. It serves as a backend for UI systems and modular applications and inventions, going much further than the basic systems previously designed.

## How Noxis started

Starlight Noxis started as a series of menus, from the original, POVR Menu (PrimeOnVR Menu,) a basic mod menu for Rec Room with built in moderation, trolling, and creation tools, to POVR Blend, a customizable and changeable module-based menu with a similar focus, to Starlight Prism, a never-released wireless, but inherently flawed app-based ui, and now, off the broken roots of Prism, Noxis, a fully fledged backend, to support these systems, without any of the flaws of the predecessors. In fact, if you would like a menu experience like made before, it is possible with the official [noxis-ui.md](official-services/noxis-ui.md "mention") service, and the apps created for it.
